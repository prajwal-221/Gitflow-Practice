Absolutely! Let's begin your GitFlow learning journey by building a **simple but realistic Python CLI To-Do List application** and using GitFlow to manage its lifecycle.

---

We'll go in **parts**. Here’s what Part 1 includes:

---

## ✅ **Part 1: Project Setup + GitFlow Initialization**

---

### 🧱 Step 1: Build a Simple CLI To-Do App in Python (with file saving)

Let’s create a **minimal, clean** To-Do List CLI app that saves tasks to a file called `tasks.txt`.

#### 📁 Project Directory Structure

```
todo-gitflow-app/
├── todo.py
└── tasks.txt      # (auto-created)
```

---

### 📝 Create the Application

```bash
mkdir todo-gitflow-app && cd todo-gitflow-app
touch todo.py
```

Paste the following into `todo.py`:

```python
import os

TASK_FILE = "tasks.txt"

def load_tasks():
    if not os.path.exists(TASK_FILE):
        return []
    with open(TASK_FILE, "r") as file:
        return [line.strip() for line in file.readlines()]

def save_tasks(tasks):
    with open(TASK_FILE, "w") as file:
        for task in tasks:
            file.write(task + "\n")

def main():
    tasks = load_tasks()
    print("📝 Welcome to the To-Do List App!")
    while True:
        print("\nOptions: [1] Add Task  [2] View Tasks  [3] Delete Task  [4] Exit")
        choice = input("Enter choice: ").strip()

        if choice == "1":
            task = input("Enter a task: ").strip()
            tasks.append(task)
            save_tasks(tasks)
            print(f"✅ Task added: {task}")

        elif choice == "2":
            if not tasks:
                print("📭 No tasks yet.")
            else:
                print("🧾 Your Tasks:")
                for i, t in enumerate(tasks, 1):
                    print(f"{i}. {t}")

        elif choice == "3":
            if not tasks:
                print("🚫 No tasks to delete.")
                continue
            for i, t in enumerate(tasks, 1):
                print(f"{i}. {t}")
            try:
                index = int(input("Enter task number to delete: "))
                if 1 <= index <= len(tasks):
                    removed = tasks.pop(index - 1)
                    save_tasks(tasks)
                    print(f"🗑️ Deleted: {removed}")
                else:
                    print("❌ Invalid task number.")
            except ValueError:
                print("❌ Please enter a number.")

        elif choice == "4":
            print("👋 Goodbye!")
            break

        else:
            print("❌ Invalid option. Try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### 🧪 Test the App

```bash
python3 todo.py
```

> Try adding, viewing, and deleting tasks. It saves tasks in `tasks.txt`.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Initialize Git and GitFlow

#### 🔧 Install `git-flow` (if not done already)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git-flow
```

#### 🗂️ Initialize Git

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Basic To-Do List App"
```

#### 🔁 Initialize GitFlow

```bash
git flow init
```

💡 You’ll be prompted with:

```
Branch name for production releases: [main]
Branch name for development: [develop]
```

Just press **Enter** to accept the defaults:

* `main`: stable production code
* `develop`: ongoing development

Prefixes (feature, release, hotfix) can also be defaulted.

---

## 📚 Summary So Far

✅ You now have:

* A working CLI Python To-Do App
* A Git repo with initial commit
* GitFlow initialized with `main` and `develop` branches

---

## 📍 Next Steps (Part 2)

In the next part, I’ll walk you through:

* Creating a new **feature** branch (e.g., marking tasks as done)
* Using `git flow feature start` and `git flow feature finish`
* What each GitFlow command does internally

---

Would you like to continue with **Part 2: Feature Branch Workflow**?



Awesome! Let’s continue with **🔧 Part 2: GitFlow Feature Branch Workflow**, where you’ll learn how to create and manage new features using GitFlow.

---

## 🚀 Part 2: Working on a New Feature with GitFlow

We’ll now:

1. Understand what a **feature branch** is in GitFlow.
2. Add a new feature: **mark tasks as done ✅**.
3. Learn what happens behind the scenes with each command.
4. Merge the feature into `develop`.

---

### 🎯 What Is a Feature Branch?

| Branch      | Purpose                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feature/*` | For **developing new features** before a release. Feature branches are created **off `develop`** and merged **back into `develop`** when done. |

> GitFlow naming: `feature/feature-name`

---

### ✅ Step 1: Start a Feature Branch

Let’s say we want to **mark tasks as completed**.

Run:

```bash
git flow feature start mark-done
```

✅ This does:

* Creates and checks out a new branch: `feature/mark-done`
* Branches **off `develop`**

---

### 💻 Step 2: Add “Mark as Done” Functionality to `todo.py`

Let’s update the app to allow users to mark tasks as completed.

🔧 Replace your `todo.py` with this updated version:

```python
import os

TASK_FILE = "tasks.txt"

def load_tasks():
    if not os.path.exists(TASK_FILE):
        return []
    with open(TASK_FILE, "r") as file:
        return [line.strip() for line in file.readlines()]

def save_tasks(tasks):
    with open(TASK_FILE, "w") as file:
        for task in tasks:
            file.write(task + "\n")

def main():
    tasks = load_tasks()
    print("📝 Welcome to the To-Do List App!")
    while True:
        print("\nOptions: [1] Add Task  [2] View Tasks  [3] Delete Task  [4] Mark as Done  [5] Exit")
        choice = input("Enter choice: ").strip()

        if choice == "1":
            task = input("Enter a task: ").strip()
            tasks.append("[ ] " + task)
            save_tasks(tasks)
            print(f"✅ Task added: {task}")

        elif choice == "2":
            if not tasks:
                print("📭 No tasks yet.")
            else:
                print("🧾 Your Tasks:")
                for i, t in enumerate(tasks, 1):
                    print(f"{i}. {t}")

        elif choice == "3":
            if not tasks:
                print("🚫 No tasks to delete.")
                continue
            for i, t in enumerate(tasks, 1):
                print(f"{i}. {t}")
            try:
                index = int(input("Enter task number to delete: "))
                if 1 <= index <= len(tasks):
                    removed = tasks.pop(index - 1)
                    save_tasks(tasks)
                    print(f"🗑️ Deleted: {removed}")
                else:
                    print("❌ Invalid task number.")
            except ValueError:
                print("❌ Please enter a number.")

        elif choice == "4":
            if not tasks:
                print("🚫 No tasks to mark.")
                continue
            for i, t in enumerate(tasks, 1):
                print(f"{i}. {t}")
            try:
                index = int(input("Enter task number to mark as done: "))
                if 1 <= index <= len(tasks):
                    if tasks[index - 1].startswith("[ ]"):
                        tasks[index - 1] = tasks[index - 1].replace("[ ]", "[x]", 1)
                        save_tasks(tasks)
                        print("✅ Task marked as done.")
                    else:
                        print("⚠️ Task is already done.")
                else:
                    print("❌ Invalid number.")
            except ValueError:
                print("❌ Please enter a number.")

        elif choice == "5":
            print("👋 Goodbye!")
            break

        else:
            print("❌ Invalid option. Try again.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

---

### 💾 Step 3: Commit the Feature

```bash
git add todo.py
git commit -m "Add mark-as-done feature"
```

---

### 🧵 Step 4: Finish the Feature

```bash
git flow feature finish mark-done
```

✅ This command:

* Merges `feature/mark-done` into `develop`
* Deletes the `feature/mark-done` branch
* Switches back to `develop`

---

### 📌 Step 5: Push Changes to GitHub

If you’ve connected a remote repo:

```bash
git push origin develop
```

## 🧠 Recap of What You Did

| Step                      | Action                                                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `git flow feature start`  | Created a feature branch from `develop`               |
| Code changes              | Added "mark as done" feature                          |
| `git flow feature finish` | Merged feature into `develop`, deleted feature branch |
| `git push origin develop` | Updated GitHub repo with changes                      |

---

### 🗺️ Next Up: Part 3 – Release Workflow

You’ll learn to:

* Start a **release** branch (`git flow release start`)
* Prepare for production (version files, docs, etc.)
* Finish and publish your first release to `main`

---

Do you want to continue to **Part 3: Release Branch Workflow**?


Perfect! Let's move on to **🚢 Part 3: GitFlow Release Branch Workflow**, where you'll simulate preparing and delivering your app to production using a **release branch**.

---

## 🚢 Part 3: Creating a Release Branch in GitFlow

We’ll now:

1. Understand the **purpose of a release branch**
2. Simulate final steps before release (e.g., tagging version, polishing docs)
3. Merge the release into both `main` and `develop`
4. Learn the Git commands and what they do

---

### 📦 What Is a Release Branch?

| Branch      | Purpose                                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `release/*` | To prepare code for production release (version bump, final testing) |
|             | Created from `develop`, merged into `main` and back into `develop`   |

Release branches allow **testing and polishing** the code before it hits `main` (production). Also, it lets you freeze features and focus on stability.

---

### ✅ Step 1: Start a Release Branch

We’ll assume the app is ready for version `v1.0.0`.

```bash
git flow release start v1.0.0
```

✅ This does:

* Creates `release/v1.0.0` from `develop`
* Checks out the release branch

---

### 📝 Step 2: Add Version Info and Polish

Let’s add a `VERSION` file and update the README.

```bash
echo "v1.0.0" > VERSION
echo "## Features" > CHANGELOG.md
echo "- Add and delete tasks" >> CHANGELOG.md
echo "- Mark tasks as done" >> CHANGELOG.md
```

```bash
git add VERSION CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Add version file and changelog for v1.0.0"
```

---

### 🧪 Step 3: (Optional) Final Test

You could run the app manually:

```bash
python3 todo.py
```

Verify all features are working.

---

### 🚀 Step 4: Finish the Release

Once you're happy with the release:

```bash
git flow release finish v1.0.0
```

✅ This does:

* Merges `release/v1.0.0` into `main`
* Tags `main` with `v1.0.0`
* Merges changes back into `develop`
* Deletes the `release/v1.0.0` branch
* Checks out `develop` again

---

### 🌍 Step 5: Push Everything to GitHub

```bash
git push origin main --tags
git push origin develop
```

---

## 🧠 Recap of What You Did

| Step                      | Action                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `git flow release start`  | Created release branch from `develop`            |
| Final polish              | Added `VERSION`, `CHANGELOG.md`                  |
| `git flow release finish` | Merged into `main` & `develop`, tagged release   |
| `git push`                | Updated remote `main`, `develop`, and pushed tag |

---

### ✅ Git Log Visual (Simplified)

```
main    ----o------o----o  ← tagged v1.0.0
               \     /
develop ----o---o---o---o
              \
feature/add-done
```

---

### 🚨 Real-World Notes:

* You can run tests or build processes in this branch before finishing.
* Teams often lock `main` and allow only release merges.

---

### 🎯 Next Up: Part 4 – Hotfix Workflow

You’ll simulate a **critical bug** in production and use `git flow hotfix` to fix it properly.

---

Do you want to continue to **Part 4: Hotfix Branch Workflow**?



Awesome! Now let’s move to **🔥 Part 4: GitFlow Hotfix Branch Workflow** — one of the most important and powerful parts of GitFlow.

---

## 🔥 Part 4: Hotfix Branches in GitFlow

### ✅ What We’ll Cover

1. What is a **hotfix** in GitFlow?
2. How to **create a hotfix branch** when there's a bug in production
3. Fix the bug, commit the changes
4. Merge it into both `main` and `develop`
5. Push and tag your changes

---

### 🩹 What Is a Hotfix Branch?

| Branch     | Purpose                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hotfix/*` | Fix **critical production bugs** immediately             |
|            | Created from `main`, merged back to `main` and `develop` |

A hotfix is a **patch for production** — used when `main` has a serious bug, and you can’t wait for the next release cycle.

---

## 🛠 Simulate a Production Bug

Imagine there's a bug: When the task file is missing, the app crashes.

Let’s simulate this fix now.

---

### 🪄 Step 1: Start a Hotfix Branch

```bash
git flow hotfix start fix-missing-file-crash
```

✅ This does:

* Creates branch `hotfix/fix-missing-file-crash` from `main`
* Checks it out

---

### 🐛 Step 2: Fix the Bug

Open `todo.py`, and **modify the file read section**:

**Before**:

```python
with open(TASK_FILE, 'r') as f:
    tasks = json.load(f)
```

**After**:

```python
if os.path.exists(TASK_FILE):
    with open(TASK_FILE, 'r') as f:
        tasks = json.load(f)
else:
    tasks = []
```

Then commit:

```bash
git add todo.py
git commit -m "Fix crash when task file is missing"
```

---

### 🧼 Step 3: Finish the Hotfix

```bash
git flow hotfix finish fix-missing-file-crash
```

✅ This does:

* Merges hotfix into `main`
* Tags it (e.g., `v1.0.1`)
* Merges into `develop` too
* Deletes the hotfix branch

---

### 🌍 Step 4: Push Changes to Remote

```bash
git push origin main --tags
git push origin develop
```

---

## 🧠 Recap of Hotfix Workflow

| Step                     | Action                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `git flow hotfix start`  | Create hotfix branch from `main`                 |
| Fix bug & commit         | Patch the code                                   |
| `git flow hotfix finish` | Merge to `main`, tag it, merge back to `develop` |
| `git push`               | Push changes and tags                            |

---

### 📈 Git History View (Simplified)

```
main    ----o----v1.0.0---o---v1.0.1
                        \     /
develop --------o--------o---o
```

---

## 🧠 Final Summary: Why GitFlow Helps

| GitFlow Branch | Purpose                      | Real-Life Use                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `main`         | Production-ready code        | Only contains tested releases  |
| `develop`      | All active development work  | Integrates features and fixes  |
| `feature/*`    | Feature in progress          | `feature/add-notifications`    |
| `release/*`    | Pre-production finalization  | Add docs, test, bump version   |
| `hotfix/*`     | Urgent bugfix for production | Fix crash, broken builds, etc. |

---

### ✅ You’ve now completed:

* A full GitFlow setup
* A feature → release → hotfix cycle
* Learned all GitFlow commands with reasoning

---

Would you like to:

1. 🔄 Start another feature? (e.g., task prioritization)
2. 🧪 Learn how to **test, lint, or CI** with GitFlow?
